# Flexible Content Blocks

Each Vue component in this directory maps to a block of Flexible Content defined 
in WordPress by the ACF plugin. 

When adding a new block, a new Vue component should be created in here for it.
It should also be added to the overall map in ~/components/AcfBlocks/FlexibleContent.vue.
